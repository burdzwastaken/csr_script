# csr_script
A script to create the CSR you need quickly

##About
The script will allow you to create csr (certificate signing requests) really quickly so you can start generating certificates. After this script has run you will need to enter the information necessary such as the name of the certificate, email address, organization and organization unit, state, city and country code (two letter code). To get the script running please run the following commands. 

	# cd ./csr_script
	# chmod +x csr.sh
	# ./csr.sh

or 
	# cd ./csr_script
	# sh csr.sh

##Results
This is alot quicker than doing a csr yourself and you will always get the right openssl configurations.
